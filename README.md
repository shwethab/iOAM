# iOAM - Mechanism to record OAM information in-band
A trip-recorder in your traffic at line rate performance

While troubleshooting or planning, did you ever wish to get full insight into which paths *all* your packets take in your network? A new technology "in-band OAM (iOAM)" is now here to help. iOAM adds forwarding path information and other information/stats to every data packet - as opposed to relying on probe packets, which is the traditional method that tools like ping or traceroute use. In-band OAM information can either be accessed directly on the router or be available via Netflow.
